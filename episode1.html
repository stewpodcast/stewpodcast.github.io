                    <h5>Introduction + Early Life</h5>
                    <p>Sophia: Hello and welcome to episode one of our podcast, Stew [elongated], where we deliver a healthy mind soup of discussions on scientific topics. Your co-hosts for today are myself, Sophia and Ebi. </p><br>
                    <p>Ebi: Yup. This episode, we’ll be focusing on the story and evolutionary theories of the esteemed naturalist Charles Robert Darwin. Let’s start with some information on his early life. </p><br>
                    <p>Sophia: For sure. Darwin was born in 1809 in Shrewsbury, Shropshire-</p><br>
                    <p>Ebi: God I- I just love that name. Shrewsbury, Shropshire just rolls off the tongue…</p><br>
                    <p>Sophia: (laughs) Sure. Darwin was the second son of society doctor Robert Waring Darwin and of Susanna Wedgwood. </p>
                    <p>At the traditional Anglican Shrewsbury School (education), science was considered dehumanizing, and his interest in chemistry and science led to Darwin becoming picked on by his schoolmates and holding the nickname “Gas”. </p><br>
                    <p>Ebi: Darwin held a fascination for the natural world from a young age. He collected plants and insects from woodlands near his home.</p><br>
                    <p>Sophia: After leaving his first school, Darwin went on to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh. Though he was there for only two years, he learned-</p><br>
                    <p>Ebi: to classify plants,</p><br>
                    <p>Sophia: stuff birds,</p><br>
                    <p>Ebi: identify rock strata,</p><br>
                    <p>Sophia: And much, much more. However, he gave up his medical pursuit after witnessing fatal surgery performed on a child;</p><br>
                    <p>Ebi: Since back then there were no anaesthetics or antiseptics, and pre-chloroform anatomy sickened him. </p><br>
                    <p>Sophia: His overbearing father now saw that church was a better calling for an aimless naturalist, and switched Darwin to Christ’s College, Cambridge, in 1828.</p><br>
                    <p>Ebi: And Darwin was now educated as an Anglican gentleman. </p><br>
                    <h5>Victorian Society At the Time</h5>
                    <p>Sophia: It’s important to note that Darwin’s lifespan, from 1809 to 1882 was under the Victorian Age. </p><br>
                    <p>Ebi: Which was marked by a “sharp flux”.</p><br>
                    <p>Sophia: Uh, Sharp flux? What’s that?</p><br>
                    <p>Ebi: A turn-of-the-century type thing. At this point in time England was regarded as the world’s wealthiest nation throughout the British Empire’s expansion.</p><br>
                    <p>Sophia: Oooh, bringing some classic literature into this! Victorians actually had contradictory feelings about their achievements.</p><br>
                    <p>Ebi: People were asking “how did we get here?”. And with new tools and technologies as well, people started looking outside the defined scope of religion.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>Sophia: Science expanded in all departments, Geology and Anthropology,</p><br>
                    <p>Ebi: Chemistry and Biology,</p><br>
                    <p>Sophia: More closer to Botany than biology, </p><br>
                    <p>Ebi: Yeah… and also Astronomy and Zoology.</p><br>
                    <p>Sophia: Principles of Geology by Charles Lyell, and On the Origin of Species by Darwin refuted century-old theories.                     </p><br>
                    <p>Ebi: Still at this time, the church did NOT approve, but people still began to rethink their positions in science, religion, and cultural tastes.
                    </p><br>
                    <h5>Our Sponsr: DIVEINTOHT.ML</h5>

                    <p>Ebi: Darwin at first shocked religious Victorian society by suggesting that animals and humans shared a common ancestry.  However, scientific viewpoint appealed to the rising class of professional scientists, and by the time of his death evolutionary theory had spread through all of science, literature, and politics.</p><br>
                    <h5>Darwin's Journey: The HMS Beagle</h5>
                    <p>Sophia: Now let’s see how Darwin came to his theory of evolution.</p><br>
                    <p>Ebi : Darwin began his journey on the now-famous HMS Beagle, which first left Plymouth in December 1831.  </p><br>
                    <p>Sophia: He boarded the HMS Beagle not as a teeming naturalist but rather a companion to the captain Robert Fitzroy, who feared the loneliness of command.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>Ebi: Oooh. Loneliness of command. Sounds poetic. 
                    </p><br>
                    <p>Sophia: It WAS poetic. This journey was to be an imperial-evangelical voyage to Tierra del Fuego: to survey coastal Patagonia and to facilitate British trade to return three “ex-savages”—</p><br>
                    <p>Ebi: What do you mean by ex-savages?</p><br>
                    <p>Sophia: They were previously brought to England from Tierra del Fuego and christianized. They would be brought back to spread the Victorian-age ideal to the rest of the “savages” still in South America.</p><br>
                    <p>Ebi: At the start of their journey, Fitzroy gave Darwin a copy of Principles of Geology by Charles Lyell.</p><br>
                    <p>Sophia: Ah, Charles Lyell. One of those rising scientific Victorian authors we mentioned earlier. But what does he have to do with Darwin? </p><br>
                    <p>Ebi: You’ll see! Now as the Beagle set sail, Darwin wondered why beautiful creatures teemed in the ocean’s vastness, where no human could appreciate them. Being his first time on sea however, he became extremely seasick. Thankfully, that didn’t matter, as Darwin’s main observations and discoveries were when the boat was either slowly cruising by coastlines or when it was docked on the shore.</p><br>
                    <p>Sophia: At the Cape Verde Islands, he saw bands of oysters running through rocks, suggesting Lyell’s theory of the land rising and falling to be true.</p><br>
                    <p>Ebi: And at Salvador de Bahia,</p><br>
                    <p>Sophia: now Salvador, Brazil</p><br>
                    <p>Ebi: left Darwin’s mind in a “chaos of delight.” On the River plate Rio de la Plata, he found Montevideo Uruguay, in a state of rebellion and joined armed sailors to retake the rebel-held fort.</p><br>
                    <p>Sophia The others on the ship were in charge of “eradicating natives”, and for a Darwin, fresh from civil Christ’s college, this was disturbing. </p><br>
                    <p>Sophia: At Tierra del Fuego, </p><br>
                    <p>Ebi: December 1832</p><br>
                    <p>Sophia: An unsettled Darwin wrote: “difference between savage & civilized man is.—It is greater between a wild & domestic animal.”</p><br>
                    <p>Ebi: On this voyage, they explored remote regions of the world and encountered new and strange species, one documented being “gaily-coloured” flatworms. Darwin was horrified by the parasitic ichneumon wasp, which stored caterpillars to be eaten alive by its grubs. </p><br>
                    <p>Sophia: Wow, ichneumon wasp sounds like such an exquisite name. Anyways … even more thought-provoking were Darwin’s fossil discoveries. Over a span of two years to cliffs at Bahia Blanca middle right of Argentina and farther south at Port St. Julian yielded huge bones of extinct mammals.</p><br>
                    <p>Ebi:  Skulls, femurs, and armour plates, he assumed these to be relics of rhinos and cow-sized armadillos. 
                        Working with fossils became a half guilty-pleasure half discovery for Darwin. He loved thinking about the primeval world and what had caused those giant beasts to die out. </p><br>
                        
                    <p>Sophia: In a way, Darwin had Lyell, and also Fitzroy - the man who gave him the book - to thank. Darwin read Principles of Geology, and simultaneously found evidence for the land to be changing through his stops on the HMS Beagle. </p><br>
                    <p>Ebi: The theorized forces of nature written by Lyell were viewed — and for that matter, felt — by Darwin. </p><br>

                    <p>Sophia: Some timeline dates include January 15, 1835 where he saw Mount Osorno erupt </p><br>

                    <p>Ebi: And February 20, 1835 where he saw the forest floor beneath him begin to shake from the violence of an earthquake. </p><br>

                    <p>Sophia: But the destruction and tidal waves were inconsequential to Darwin. He remarked that the local mussel-beds, had risen, and were dry above the high tide, proving Lyell’s theory about the land rising to be correct. </p><br>

                    <p>Ebi: These natural effects made Darwin think about the world around him, and began thinking in terms of deep time. </p><br>

                    <p>Sophia: Here’s when things get interesting. On the way back home (Starting from Peru in 1835), supposedly when the discoveries and scientific breakthroughs waned, Darwin landed on the Galapagos Islands. </p><br>

                    <p>Ebi: Now contrary to popular belief, these islands were not the source of  Darwin’s “eureka” moment. These only provided the sources necessary for his later theory of evolution. </p><br>

                    <p>Sophia: The Galapagos Islands, though in close proximity, had several different variations of the same species. He noted differing qualities of mockingbirds, but failed to label wrens, “gross-beaks”, and most notably finches, properly. We’ll get into this soon. </p><br>

                    <p>Ebi: Darwin didn’t arrive to the islands looking to prove a theory on evolution, but was merely taking notes and drawings, as he had done on every other stop on his journey. </p><br>

                    <p>Sophia: He returned in 1837, with a finished 770-page diary, 1750 pages of notes, 12 catalogs of 5436 collected skin, bones, and carcasses, and most importantly, enough unanswered questions to last him a lifetime. </p><br>
                    <p>Ebi: But of all his explorations, one idea was stuck in his head. Was each Galapagos mockingbird a naturally produced variety? </p><br>
                    
                    <h5>Darwin's Return: The Development of Evolution</h5>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: Darwin’s agnostic mindset and mentality cultivated from reading and experiencing Principles of Geology gave him the courage to look beyond the Victorian culture for new answers. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: Now with a monthly allowance from his father, Darwin settled down as a new fellow of the Geological Society by January 1837. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: He became close friends with Lyell, discussing the rising Chilean coastline. Soon, he became secretary of the society by 1838. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: Actually, in his diary’s publication was an article titled Journal of Researches into the Geology and Natural History of the Various Countries Visited by HMS Beagle. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: Wow… that’s a handful of a title. Wish he could be more concise like Lyell, with his “Principles of Geology” </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: Well at least we know it’s Darwin’s. Anyways, he continued publishing. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: With a 1000 pound Treasury Grant, he hired the best experts to document his specimens, which was collected in an article titled Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S Beagle. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: That’s a better title, don’t you think? (Chuckles) </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: You know, it’s a work in progress [sarcastic]. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: Aside from his smaller articles, let’s talk about Darwin’s evolutionary theory of natural selection. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: He began devising his theory following the First Reform Act. This was a great period of civil unrest, where nonconformists denounced the power of the church. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: Darwin was a Unitarian-</p><br><p>Sophia: That is, someone who bases their conclusions of off experience and logic </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: -and said the following regarding mankind’s place in nature: </p><br>“Animals—whom we have made our slaves we do not like to consider our equals. —Do not slave holders wish to make the black man other kind?” </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: Now a lot of Darwin’s fossil labels turned to be incorrect. At the Zoological Society, John Gould announced that the wrens, “gross-beaks”, and finches documented by Darwin were all differently adapted ground finches. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: Darwin then checked with Fitzroy’s collection of notes and specimens to find that each island had its own representative finch. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: Darwin was puzzled to say the least. He began note-taking and theorizing in secret, for a potential discovery on “transmutation”-</p><br><p>Ebi: Now we call that “evolution” </p><br><p>Sophia: -And that would challenge church and social understanding. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: Darwin ended up with a 35-page sketch of his theory but had no immediate motive of publishing it. It’s important to know that a THEORY of evolution was floating around at this point, but it was never scientifically confirmed. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: Darwin was the one with the scientific proof. He told Emma Wedgewood, his cousin and his wife,  that in the case of his death, an editor should be paid 400 pounds to publish his work. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: Sounds very secretive. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: Oh it was. Darwin said that believing in evolution was “like confessing a murder” Quite literally, in fact, atheists using evolutionary theories to challenge the Anglican oppression were being jailed for spreading controversy. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: Darwin even took a break from the whole evolution section. He pursued a detailed study on, can you guess? </p><br>
                    <p>Sophia: Umm, let me try to think of something far for the whole idea of birds for now… Sea horse? I don’t know [puzzled] </p><br>
                    <p>Ebi: No! Again? </p><br>
                    <p>Sophia: Oh god… let’s just say [contemplating] fossils. </p><br>
                    <p>Ebi: No, it was barnacles of all things!  Intrigued by their sexual differentiation, he discovered that tiny degenerate males would cling to females. (both chuckling) </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: Wow, I definitely did NOT expect that. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: But evolution was still Darwin’s main theory. There were two parts to this, natural selection and artificial selection. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: First, natural selection. Darwin defined it as the “principle by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved.” </p><br>
                    
                    <h5>Summary: DNA</h5>
                    <p>Ebi: What do we mean by slight variation? Well we have to look at DNA for that. </p><br>
                    
                    DNA (basically the code that makes us) is a set of genetic instructions. DNA from both the mother and the father are replicated for the offspring. Mistakes in the replication process alter the genetic code for the offspring. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: This leads to a slight variation in the offspring. Now if the genetic code has been altered enough, entire parts of the body can change. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: Essentially, a large variation is what we call a mutation. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: Mutations and variations are often detrimental, but sometimes they can be useful. Darwin said that if they ARE useful, then through generations, it will be preserved. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: That’s similar to “survival of the fittest,” because those with beneficial mutations became better suited to their environment, and so have a better chance of surviving until reproduction, passing their mutation onto their offspring, and so on. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: So many think that, for example, a giraffe “evolved” to get a long neck to reach the tall tree leaves. In reality, a longer neck was a mutation, but it was helpful, so it stuck around. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: Sort of like a game of trial and error. </p><br>
                    
                    <h5>Observations from the HMS Beagle</h5>
                    <p>Sophia: This idea stemmed from observations made when Darwin collected finches from the Galápagos Islands (off the coast of Ecuador) during the second voyage of the beagle, which were a group of around 18 passerine bird species, holding classification from the subfamily Geospizinae or tribe Geospizini. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: The size of the finches varied from 10 to 20 centimetres and weighed 8 to 38 grams, with the vegetarian finches being the largest and the smallest being the warbler-finches. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: Between the species within the finches that Darwin collected, the birds were highly adapted to their various food sources and were distinguished largely through their differing beak sizes and shapes. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: For example, some of the birds have stout beaks for eating seeds but others specialized in eating insects and therefore had the a thinner, sharper beak. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: Initially on the voyage, Darwin paid little attention to these differences within the birds. Only after the voyage did he compare his specimens with those collected by the Captain of the HMS Beagle, Robert Fitzroy, and later created conclusions to support his theory outlined in his publication called The Voyage of the Beagle. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: What was fascinating about this and how it supported Darwin’s theory is that the different species of birds who had vastly different beak characteristics were all from the descendent! </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: That is very interesting actually, because you would expect that they would have come at least from descendants who at least had some degree of varying traits that resulted in these beak variations. As noted in The Voyage of the Beagle, Darwin realized that the birds had split off and gone to different islands and adapted to eat their respective available foods. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: The ending result of this was that the process of natural selection had produced thirteen species of unique finch, each highly adapted to different sources of food. </p><br>
                    
                    <h5>Artificial Selection</h5>
                    <p>Sophia: Now to support natural selection, Darwin and his infamous pigeons came up with artificial selection. He just (chuckles) couldn’t get away from birds! </p><br>

                    <p>Sophia: Now, Ebi, I know you’re someone who loves analogies. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: Sure do. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: So here’s why I think you would love this upcoming section: after coming up with his theory, he actually found the concept of natural selection analogous to how farmers were able to breed specific crops or livestock together to form new “types”. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: Oh right! He called this “artificial selection,” and and wanted to experiment with this idea with… not finches, but pigeons? [perplexed] </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: He did it the same way that farmers would artificially breed too, but applied it to pigeons instead. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: Specifically, by crossing birds with particulate characteristics to make different offspring—  okay, particulate? </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: Yeah… </p><br>
                    
                    
                    <p>Ebi: Really? No, a particulate, is a piece of food, like, oh, there's a chicken particulate left on my toaster. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: Okay… particular. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: There’s a there's a there's a particulate of my bread on the plate after a… God. [disappointed]. Anyways, specifically by crossing birds with particular characteristics to make different offspring so that the birds bred would have exaggerated features such as changing color of their feathers, and also the length of their beaks or legs. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: And Darwin was a very committed pigeon fancier who approached this new hobby meticulously. In his garden, he filled a dovecote that he built with pigeons purchased from London and used only the fanciest breeds such as pouters, carriers, barbs, fantails, and so on. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: Another analogy within this experiment that Darwin made was one between pigeon breeding and Nature, where Nature was the fancier that selected the ones able to reproduce. And this showed the similarities between artificial selection and natural selection, which was the heart of his explanation later written in his “On the Origin of Species”. </p><br>
                    
                    
                    <p>Sophia: And a great modern repercussion of his studies with pigeons that I read recently was that scientists are now following Darwin’s examples by using birds to examine mutations that created different anatomy with geographical areas. This new research would support Darwin’s hypothesis that rock pigeons were the great descendants of all pigeon breeds, according to the New York Times. </p><br>
                    
                    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: Now you might be wondering, what happened to Darwin AFTER he published book titled “On the Origin of Species”? As expected, after publication he closely monitored debates that took place regarding his ideas. Specifically, there were mixed religious views on his publication. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: The Church of England scientific establishment reacted against the theories, while the Liberal Anglicans strongly supported the notion that “natural selection was part of God’s design. 
                    </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: Later on, Darwin returned home and continued on small experiments such as using chloroform on carnivorous sundew plants </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: So now you might ask us again why does knowing all this even matter? </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: Well, we strongly believe that Darwin and his evolutionary theories are still incredibly relevant to this day, even after over 150 years since the publication of On the Origin of Species. 
                    </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: Darwin’s ideas are considered to be the fundamental ideas for natural selection and the theory of evolution. Sophia, let’s talk a little bit about what this research has meant for us, and likely for our listeners as well. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>I think one of the biggest things for me was that Darwin actually, well as we said, he got it wrong when he was documenting, he thought there were mockingbirds, and wrens, and gross-beaks, as they called them then. And only again, when the people from the zoology society, they were the only ones who called Darwin that “yeah, this is wrong.” </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: Yeah. And also speaks on like, the trial and error idea that's emphasized so much in science, and when we're doing any, you know, experience- experiments in class, like, everything has, you know, sources of error, and you want to keep doing different trials. And then, because, yeah, in science, you're so prone to making errors, and I think it's the idea that that's okay. That's really emphasized with Darwin's story. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: Yeah, and even the fact that he was wrong. I mean, he definitely, based on his other experiences. He was, he was able to identify things such as when the earthquake happened, and the rising beds, like he was able to see that, wow, the land is rising. And I think that speaks for like, Darwin probably wasn't a bad naturalist, those finches must have just been so different from each other, that that's why he got it wrong, and that's why he mislabeled it, which just speaks to know how powerful the natural selection was. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: Yeah, and I can't imagine what it would have been like to, like, when you come across a scientist and a new theory, a new concept that has never been published before. So you're just kind of navigating the waters and you don't really know what's out there to say. And something that I found really interesting was Darwin's whole experiment with the pigeons like, like before researching for this podcast, it just never occurred to me that you were able to breed it different characteristics, and I was looking online at the images of these pigeons, and their characteristics are really, really exaggerated. And I would have still, I would never expect to see any pigeons that look like that in real life. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: And the fact that he was able to do that, like in his lifespan, right, you must have to think like how drastic… what measures Did he go through? I'm assuming it was almost like only five, like a couple of years, really. And he was able to get such differences, which just proved natural selection. Another thing that I was really interested by was Charles Lyell. Like, what would have happened if Fitzroy just didn't give Darwin, the book, Principles of Geology, like Darwin, like, as he read it, he was just thinking about all these different things, which I think is what led him. I think some very good thing as work helped him to take notes and document things. He was just in that sort of mindset. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: Yeah, it's the idea that science is about collaboration also. And that usually, when you're in the news, you're like, oh, yeah, this particular this singular scientist was the one who discovered all these theories. But a lot of these, like, online researches never shows you just like, because there's usually so many more people involved in the proof of the theory or like discovery of something and it's just not. Oftentimes, it's not a singular, you know, person who discovered all these things. </p><br>
                    
                    
                    <p>Ebi: Yeah, that definitely sticks around to this day. I mean, we read we also definitely read a lot of journal articles. And you scroll down and there's like, I would say, there's just so many sources. Yeah. And it's hard to track them all. But like even Darwin, maybe he didn't pull directly from Principles of Geology. But definitely he was thinking about how things change. And so it's just interesting to see how that's developed and how we refer to literature, scientific literature nowadays. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: For sure, I really like also just finding out more about, you know, the Victorian era, and the sort of public conceptions of science at that point, and how religion actually played a really big factor in that. And you can also consider, like, in modern days, like the political side of science, you know, for example, with vaccines or whatever, like there's, science is also not just about the pure facts when you're dealing with the public. It's also about politics, sort of, like social ideas like religion now. Yeah. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Ebi: Alright, so anyway, that is it for episode one of Stew. Thank you for joining us, and we hope that you took away something from this podcast, regardless of what it was. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>Sophia: Once again, your hosts today were Sophia and Ebi. Stay tuned for more to come in the future! </p><br>
